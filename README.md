Using Machine Learning to Identify Community Water Systems Most Vulnerable to Drought

The California State Water Resources Control Board needs to identify community water systems that are most vulnerable to drought to reduce the impact of running out of water or reliance on contaminated sources. The traditional method of risk scoring aggregates risk indicators with assigned thresholds and weighing factors. Machine learning provides an alternate method that is less resource extensive and avoids the subjective and arbitrary nature of threshold and weight assignments. We trained several machine learning models to recognize the patterns in risk indicator data and compared model performances according to several performance metrics. The best-performing model is used to identify the most vulnerable community water systems.
